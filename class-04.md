**Chapter 4: Links**
* Identify the difference between relative and absolute links. Relative links are used to navigate on the same page.
* Linking to specific parts of a page by using the href and id fields in an index section is a way to help users navigate the site.

**Chapter 15: Layout**
* There are many types of ways to position elements on a page. Thus far I have used fixed width using pixel values. I find that it is more predicatable this way. However, I can see the advantages of using a more liquid layout as it would accomodate more screen sizes.
* I am wondering if Live Server or another VS Code extension can emulate other windows sizes such as mobile for testing purposes.
* Using the z-index allows elements to occupy the same space but sit on top of one another.
* So far I have been using combinations of flex-column and flex-row to create layouts during my labs. However, using the 960.gs grid layout seems like it would be easier to maintain.

**Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects**
* The beginning of this chapter is just highlighting the types of functions that exist. I have used these types of functions in our labs to separate the code into a more readable format.
* I found out the hard way in one of my labs to make sure variables are scoped appropriately as mentioned in this chapter.

**Article: 6 Reasons for Pair Programming**
* This was a great article that articulated a lot about what I was feeling during today's paired programming lab session. 
* The point that spoke most to me is the engaged collaboration. Often times developers will create a silo for themselves and code and tend to not explain their work. By collaborating on a problem there is more than one developer present. This not only helps catch mistakes as they happen but also maintainability becomes easier if bugs appear. This ensures that there is redundancy built in so no one developer is the only subject matter expert on the codebase.
* The other point that spoke to me is the job interview readiness. Often times I am writing code and can't put into words why or how it works. By explaining to a partner it slows the mind down to process what is happening step-by-step. This is advantageous for those technical interviews where the candidate needs to work out their thought process out loud.
