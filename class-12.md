**chart.js**
* I was not able to get the tutorial to work, as others have mentioned, but I did download the GitHub repository linked on the page. Within the repository there are a bunch of chart types under the sample folder. This included doughnut, radar, bubble charts, and more. This will be useful to reference as examples if needed in the future.

**Basic Usage**
* Use fallbacks to ensure something displays if the canvas element fails to render in a browser.
* The web page must be fully loaded before a canvas element will execute and render.
* The canvas element can be used for general drawings and diagrams other than charts.

**Drawing Shapes With Canvas**
* Only rectangles and paths can be drawn directly using canvas functions. All other complex shapes need to be constructed from paths.
* You can create negative space in an already rendered shape.
* There are many possibilities to combine straight lines, quadratics curves, etc. to make intricate shapes - such as Pac Man!
* It is very interesting to me that SVG and canvas have some overlap. When using SVG files for labs I noticed that opening them in a text edit had a bunch of numbers and geometric commands similar to what is being presented here.

**Applying styles and colors**
* There are various properties you can change such as transparency, line color, fill color, line width, and more to enhance canvas elements. 
* Can create animations such as dotted lines moving around a circle.
* Can repeat drawings to create patterns.

**Drawing Text**
* This page just goes over the options when putting text on a canvas element.
