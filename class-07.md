**Domain Modeling Article**

* While going through the exercise I did not quite understand what prototype objects were used for. I watched these two videos on YouTube which helped clear it up:
  * [Understand JavaScript Prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MLsg-jv2D08&ab_channel=CodeExplained)
  * [JavaScript Classes vs Prototypes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XoQKXDWbL1M&ab_channel=SteveGriffith)
* To summarize my understanding, the [object].prototype inherits the [object] properties and stores methods that the [object] can reference. This is counter to my intuition of the function methods just existing within the actual [object] itself.
* The **this** statement seems very powerful within constructors to create new objects.

**Chapter 6: Tables**

* Tables are extremely useful to store data and information on web pages so it is very important to learn how to manipulate them!
* Rendering a table via flat file (.js) like today seemed a bit tedious. I am hoping that once we get into backend database technologies and SQL we will be able to return data more easily to display in tables.

**Chapter 3: Functions, Methods, and Objects**

* This section did not mention prototypes like the article did. However, doing a bit of research it looks like prototypes are best practice over the constructor methods.
* Programs can recognize the **this** keyword for global variables within global functions such as in document.write(this.width).
* It makes a lot of sense when this book mentions the three types of built-in objects: browser, DOM, and global variables.
* The rest of this chapter has a lot of built-in functions that are useful to reference. This includes those to find the date/time, window size, and math functions.
