* I feel like there is so much to learn while going through Alchemy that I need to focus on one thing at a time. Not only do I want to learn how to code but I also want to learn things such as how to easily navigate the keyboard shortcuts or be an expert on user design to build the most aesthetically pleasing site.

* When traversing the DOM there needs to be caution that whitespace nodes are taken into account. jQuery solves many of these issues.
* The Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) section reminded me of the XKCD comic with Bobby Tables (https://xkcd.com/327/).
