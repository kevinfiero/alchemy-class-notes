**Local Storage Article**
* Sounds like there were a lot of politics during the evolution of what is now HTML5 Storage!
* Using key/value pairs seems very useful but also limiting. For example, in order to associate multiple properties across objects, you would need to create many sets of key/value pairs then iterate over each to find the data you are looking to obtain. This seems more ideal for smaller amounts of data rather than complex relational operations. Using SQL sent to a database seems better for larger relations.
* It is interesting that there is as many SQL languages as there are types of databases. Oracle, Microsoft, MySQL, etc. all use slightly different syntax in some way.
* Hoping I never encounter a QUOTA_EXCEEDED_ERR message!!
