**Google Teams Article**
* Pro-tip: If your eyes are strained from staring at your computer all day then user a text reader to copy and paste the article content so you can listen to the article. I used this website: https://www.naturalreaders.com/online/.
* Group dynamics play a large role in whether or not a team will be successful. The example in the beginning of the article points to two teams, each with like-minded and friendly individuals. However, one team seemed to flourish together while the other was often times unbearable.
* Group work has ballooned 50% in the past two decades as problems solved at work become more complex.
* Google's initial findings for Project Aristotle determined there were not strong correlations between individual team members and their team's success. For example, strangers vs. friends, micromanagement vs. hands-off management, and similar vs dissimilar educational backgrounds did not show a strong correlation.
* Group norms had high importance in later studies. This includes things such as unwritten rules such as whether non-work chit-chat was allowed, whether team members cut one another off, and whether ideas were encouraged or shut down.
* Good teams emerge when individuals respect others on the team. This helps foster a higher collective intelligence. 
* Two prominent correlations seem to be that it is important that (1) team members contribute almost equally in conversation and (2) social sensitivity is recognized among one another. These contribute to members having a high amount of psychological safety.
* Engineers often avoid conversations involving their feelings. However, taking the time out to evaluate these things will help the group thrive in the long run.
* Checking in with team members to talk about things outside of work help provide the group with a sense of psychological safety.

**Link I: Transforms**
* This article is about the basics of transforms including: *rotate*, *scale*, *translate*, and *skew*.
* Transforms can be combined to create more complex effects.
* The point of *origin* for a transform can be specified. The default is the center of the element.
* The *persepctive* property allows the object to skew based on a vanishing point.
* 3D translations add a *scaleZ* property can be used similar to those for 2D elements.
* Addtionally, 3D elements can take the *backface visibility* property which can hide an element during part of it's rotation.

**Link II: Transitions & Animations**
* Transitions occured with a state change including *hover* or *focus*.
* There are **tons** of transition properties that can be specified including *duration*, *color*, *visibility*, and *word spacing*.
* Animations use use of @keyframes. I noticed these in the Alchemy bootstrap used for the main page rotating logo.
* The bouncing balls in this article remind me of the original Windows screensaver where the color would change when it hit the side of the screen.
* These animations are really cool but will need to come back to reference this page as there are so many possibilities!

**Link III: 8 CSS3 Transitions**
* These transition examples seem extremely practical. In the previous articles there were tons of examples with bouncing balls and rotating images that I don't see on a daily basis browsing the web. However, inset border or change color seems to be practical for small nuanced effects.

**Link IV: 6 Buttons Animated**
* This will be a good example to reference when using multiple techniques.

**Link V: CSS3 Keyframe Animations**
* This HTML and CSS code is impressive. It is surprising that a bouncing ball like this can be done via just these two languages. On the flip side though, this does involve over 100 lines of code for such a small example which illustrates its complexity.

**Link VI: 404**
* Another cool example. One application this could be that instead of using a pre-made text .gif, a developer can fully customize an animation for their needs.

**Link VII: Pure CSS Bounce Animation**
* Another impressive animation through using just HTML and CSS. Similar to previous examples, there is a ton of CSS code to get this to work.
