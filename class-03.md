* In Chapter 3: "Lists" there was an overview of lists we covered in class already including unordered and ordered lists. However, it was the first time seeing definition lists.
* In Chapter 13: "Boxes" there was a lot of material we already covered such as padding, border, margin, width, and height. They also cover min-width which I found useful on earlier assignments to keep the text from scrunching on itself when the browser width is changed. I think the most interesting part of this chapter was the ability to change each side of the border sides independently. This includes the width, color, and even adding images. We already covered rounded corners in class but taking this a step further to elliptical shapes was new to me.
* Chapter 2: "Basic JavaScript Instructions" covered arrays. This includes how to create, access elements, and various properties.
* In Chapter 4: "Decision and Loops" the most interesting take away was the difference between *while* loops and *do while* loops. In the former, the condition must be met before entering the loop and the latter can execute before checking that condition. From my experience in code prior to Alchemy while loops were always frustrating because infinite loops were inevitable at some point!
