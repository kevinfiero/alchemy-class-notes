**Chapter 15: Layout**
* We were able to use a combination of float and flex-direction to get most of our stuff positioned on the page for the Chocolate Pizza assignment.
* I have found fixed width has been easier to work with but it is limiting because not all users will have the same size screen. I am hoping to get better at using percentages and the liquid layout to be more adaptable to different devices.
* It is super important to have stylesheets layed out properly from top to bottom. During Friday's lab we were seeing this really had an impact on the page when moving CSS around the file.

**Chapter 10: Error Handling & Debugging**
* I have found keeping variables in the correct scope is important as to not get unexpected results.
* There are so many error types that I have come across. Some are self-evident once I look at the message but others seem to be more cryptic. For example, I find syntax errors are much more easily resolved that reference errors.
* Many of these debugging tips we went over in class. I have found using the developer tools of inspecting the page and following the error has been the most helpful. There are other times where no error is thrown but the program is not behaving as expected.
* I learned that you can group console messages in this chapter. This could be helpful if multiple variables need to be looked at in the console at once.
* Error handling is an interesting concept because there are many approaches. For example, you can prevent the user from inputting a text value into a number form. Another possibility is using a Try, Catch, Finally block to log out known errors when things go wrong in an expected way.
