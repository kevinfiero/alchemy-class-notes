* In the first three chapters on the reading list about HTML I am amazed at how many HTML tags exist and the subtle differences between them. Currently, deciding whether to use tags such as div, article, summary, and section seem a bit arbitrary to me as a novice developer. I am hoping it becomes more clear over time which tag to use. I assume the evolution of HTML evolved away from using just div tags for good reason. Other tags such as iframe, img, form, etc. seem much more straight-forward with clear use cases.
* I get a bit overwhelmed by thinking about the Chapter 18: "Process & Design". I think the barebones planning and general wireframes are extremely helpful before jumping into the code. However, there are entire positions dedicated to UI/UX research and exactly where buttons should go on pages and the color palette being consistent across a website. It is a bit daunting to learn _how to create a website_ through code while simultaneously learning _how to design a website_ using other techniques. There is also the debate on how far should a design be laid out versus giving the developer leeway to make adjustments as they go along. I think this is a good example where having different skill sets on a software development team can help produce a better quality product.
* In Chapter 1: "The ABC of Programming" I think section 1c resonated with me the most. Prior to Alchemy I had exposure to different object-oriented programming languages similar to JavaScript. Separately, I was also familiar with HTML and CSS. However, prior to last week I never really understood the complexities of how putting them all together worked. This section illustrates how each of the three components are necessary to creating a cohesive and interactive web page.
