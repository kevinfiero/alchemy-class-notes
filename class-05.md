**Chapter 5: Images**
* This chapter was straight-forward with how to handle images on the web. I learned that .JPEG is better for displaying images with a lot of color variation whereas .PNG is better for more solid colors such as logos.
* During the labs I have been using scalable vector graphics (.SVG) format for icons that are clickable or move around such as the rock, paper, and scissor images. I found this to be easier so that the background color of the div behind it surrounded the image rather than worrying about whitespace within an image.

**Chapter 11: Color**
* I find it interesting that there are so many ways to reference color on a web page. This include RGB, Hex values, and color names. Growing up when I was doing school projects that involved color in a powerpoint or something else I found RGB values to be easiest to manipulate. However, during the labs over the past week I have been using the website coolors.co to grab hex values and compare color palettes.

**Chapter 12: Text**
* I have been using Google Fonts to import to projects in order to provide alternative fonts rather than browser defaults.
* The UPPERCASE function has been handy when comparing strings in JavaScript. This allows for variations in upper and lower case letters to be formatted the same in order to be evaluated in a conditional statement.
* There are many ways to format text as the user interacts with it. For example, when clicking a link the text may change color or when hovering text on a button may get larger.
* Interacting with HTML tags requires the manipulation of text depending on the context. For example, needing all the HTML tags that begin with the letter 'H' would lead a developer to invoke the prefix attribute selector [^=].
