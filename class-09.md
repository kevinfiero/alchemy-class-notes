**Chapter 7: Forms**
* There are so many types of forms. Picking the right one will simplify user validation. For example, using a drop-down instead of a text form eliminates a lot of headaches with bad input text data.
* The file input box looks like it would have been useful for adding an image to a new eCommerce product.
* The legend tag looks neat and can be used as an alternative to a title above a group of fields.
* Form validation looks extremely helpful to weed out any bad input data a user may try to submit.

**Chapter 14: Lists, Tables & Forms**
* This chapter seems to put some bells and whistles on what we have already learned. Some things that caught my attention:
  * Use images for bullets
  * Style input forms
  * Change cursor style

**Chapter 6: Events**
* There are a TON of event types! This is why software developers need to Google on the daily.
* I feel that event handlers are really where things can get messy in JavaScript code. In the eCommerce lab my event handler would trigger function calls across multiple util files. Refactoring would probably help but it feels like going down the rabbit hole.
* I found the section on event delegation helpful. It makes sense that if you have too many event listeners on the page it could slow it down. For example, having an event listener at the table level would be much more efficient than have one in every cell.
* This chapter was extremely dense and feel I need to go back a second time or reference it sometime down the road.
