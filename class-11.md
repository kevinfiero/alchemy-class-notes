* Create class names for differing image sizes rather than specifying pixel width and height for each individual image.
* I found during the labs that scaling images before putting them in the assets folder is preferential to adjusting their dimensions on page load in CSS. This is because there will be a fraction of a second where the image needs to rescale on page load that may look weird to the user.
* Float is helpful when putting text next to images such as in headers or long paragraphs.
* Image rollovers are a good way to give the user feedback. I found this helpful during the rock-paper-scissors lab when rolling over an option would slightly enlarge the image. Other options include changing text color or adding a border.

**Chapter 19: Practical Information**
* Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is important to get your page at the top of a Google search. There are various techniques to accomplish this including: repeating key words in text, adding descriptions to links, and relevant home page web address.
* Finding out who is visiting your site can be extremely helpful by using tools such as Google Analytics. For example, you may be a small business that can determine most of the web traffic is coming from the southwestern United States. Using this information you can fortify more advertisement effort there or try to branch out from the area and redirect advertising to other parts of the country.
* Third party tools such as those for FTP can be extremely helpful. There is no need to reinvent the wheel if others have already done the hard work!
